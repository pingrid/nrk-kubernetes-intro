# Introduction to Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform 

Welcome to our workshop about Kubernetes ! 👋😄

### Choose between one of these setups: 
1. [**Set up your own cluster on Google Cloud Platform**](https://linemos.github.io/kubernetes-intro/lidev-introduction-to-kubernetes-cluster).
In order to create your own cluster, you will have to register your credit card. You will not be charged anything for this workshop if you haven't already used Google Cloud Platform. 


2. [**Set up your own cluster on Microsoft Azure**](https://pingrid.github.io/nrk-kubernetes-intro/docs/pingrid-nrk-introduction-to-kubernetes-cluster). 
In order to create your own cluster, you will have to register your credit card. You will not be charged anything for this workshop if you haven't already used Microsoft Azure. 


Happy coding! 🎉


**Not available right now** 
3. [**Authenticate with a service account**](https://linemos.github.io/kubernetes-intro/lidev-introduction-to-kubernetes-namespace).
You will use a service account to against a cluster we have already created. This will make the workshop smaller since you will not be able to do all the tasks (i.e., create build triggers and apply changes to the application code)
