## Content of the repository
 - [Tasks and documentation](https://pingrid.github.io/nrk-kubernetes-intro/pingrid-nrk-introduction-to-kubernetes-cluster/)
 - [Code for frontend application](https://github.com/pingrid/nrk-kubernetes-intro/tree/master/frontend)
 - [Code for backend application](https://github.com/pingrid/nrk-kubernetes-intro/tree/master/backend)
 - [Kubernetes deployment files](https://github.com/pingrid/nrk-kubernetes-intro/tree/master/yaml)
 
### Javascript or typescript? 🧐 
Notice that the frontend code is written with React and redux. It is both available in [typescript](https://github.com/pingrid/nrk-kubernetes-intro/tree/typescript-react-redux) and [javascript](). The typescript code is more updated, but is also more complex. Choose whatever you like, but focus on deploying the applications.
